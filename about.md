**Welcome to zoug.me!** Thanks for being here. I'm *Yassine Zouggari*, or *zoug*, and this is my little internet space where you'll find various things. Those things include articles about **software development**, **Linux sysadmin**, and any subject I find interesting and would like to ramble about. Feel free to come here from time to time if your interests are close to mine, or follow me on your favorite social networks to be notified when new posts are published.

I'm currently a third-year engineering student at [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/), and I've done several things throughout the years, working under the name of Pomologue for I2C Media Ltd. as technical writer on [iPhoneAddict.fr](http://iphoneaddict.fr/) and [KultureGeek.fr](http://kulturegeek.fr/). I've also authored [JB ToolBox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbtoolbox/) and produced Apple-related YouTube videos as [LePomologue](http://youtube.com/user/LePomologue). 

For more academic and professional infos, my CV is [available here](/assets/files/cv.pdf).

I feel very strongly about **privacy** and use open-source software as much as possible, so that I know what the code actually does. I encourage everybody to do the same! My code is for the most part published under the **GPL**.
